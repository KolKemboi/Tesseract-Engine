<p id="description">This is a simple OpenGL engine designed for loading and editing models. The engine integrates essential libraries like GLFW for window management GLAD for OpenGL function loading ImGui for UI stb_image for image loading Assimp for model loading and GLM for mathematics (vectors matrices etc.).</p>

<h2>Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

*   Window Management using GLFW
*   OpenGL Function Loading with GLAD
*   Model Loading using Assimp (supports popular formats like .obj and .fbx)
*   Texture Loading with stb\_image
*   Math Support with GLM (Vectors Matrices Transformations)
*   Custom User Interface powered by ImGui
*   Camera system with basic movement and rotation
*   Support for basic lighting (ambient diffuse and specular)

  
<h2> Built with</h2>

Technologies used in the project:

*   GLFW – Window and input management
*   GLAD – OpenGL function loader
*   ImGui – Immediate mode GUI for debugging and tweaking settings
*   stb\_image – Simple image loading (for textures)
*   Assimp – Asset Import Library (for loading 3D models)
*   GLM – OpenGL Mathematics library (for handling matrices vectors etc.)


<h2>Future Enhancements</h2>

*   More advanced lighting techniques (e.g., shadow mapping, PBR)
*   Support for skeletal animation
*   Integration with physics engine (e.g., Bullet Physics)
*   Scene graph system for managing objects
*   Post-processing effects (bloom, HDR)
